Football Squares
================

This web app allows a group of 2 to 8 people to play the game of Football Squares.
Unlike the conventional game play where each participant buys a square, this app randomly assigns the squares to the game board.
The distribution of squares is equal amongst participants unless the number of participants is not divisible by 100 (10 X 10 Matrix).
In this event, the remaining squares will be assigned to a random sample (without replacement) of participants.

##Instructions

1. Enter the names of the 2 competing teams.
2. Add between 2 and 8 players.
3. Create the game matrix.
